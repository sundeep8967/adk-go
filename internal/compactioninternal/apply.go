// resume as a later event that no summary covers. That surviving response would
// be orphaned, which breaks the call/response pairing prompt assembly requires.
//
// For each orphaned response the original call event is restored from
// sourceEvents (the pre-substitution list) and inserted just before the first
// surviving response referencing it. The whole call event comes back so
// parallel calls stay intact, and for every sibling call in it whose response

// Only long-running calls are recovered, and that is the only shape this can

// call ID arriving after the window, which is exactly the long-running pattern:
// a placeholder response closes the pair, the pair is compacted, and the real
