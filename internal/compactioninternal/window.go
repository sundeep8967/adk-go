// A single left-to-right pass tracks "open" obligations keyed by call ID: a
// function call, or a tool-confirmation request, opens one; a function response
// with the same ID closes it. Responses are applied before calls within one
// event, so a response only ever closes an obligation opened by an earlier
// event. Summarizing is safe exactly at the points where nothing is open, so
// the prefix ending at the last such point is returned.
//
// The result is empty when the window never reaches a balanced point, which
// tells the caller to skip this compaction rather than strand a half-finished
// tool interaction. Without this, a summary could swallow a function call while
// leaving its response behind, which downstream prompt assembly rejects.
//
// The prefix is additionally pulled back off a timestamp tie. Compaction
// coverage is an inclusive timestamp range, so if the first excluded event
// shares a timestamp with the last included one, it would fall inside the
// summarized range without having been summarized, and disappear from the
// prompt. Cutting before the whole tied group keeps "summarized" and "covered"
